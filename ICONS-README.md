## Need Help?

If you can't create icons right now, you can:
1. Use any PNG image and resize it (even a screenshot works for testing)
2. Ask a designer friend
3. Use free tools mentioned above
4. We can add proper icons later - the extension will still work!

The extension **requires** these icon files to load, but they can be simple placeholder images for testing.
